# MadeMeDance

This application helps you identify songs by matching your body's rhythm to the music's beat. When a match is found, the app saves a short audio clip. You can then use this clip to identify the song through Google Search.

## How to Build

To build and run this project, you'll need to have Android Studio and the Android SDK installed.

## To-Do List

### Playlist Integration (YouTube Music / Spotify)

-   **Reasoning:** The original request included the ability to add the identified song to a playlist on a music streaming service. This feature would complete the user's workflow, from dancing to a song to saving it for later listening.
-   **Tasks:**
    -   Integrate with the Spotify and/or YouTube Music API.
    -   Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
    -   Add UI elements to allow the user to select a service and add the song to a playlist.
